## Wild Cards

- Wilds include cards such as Joker, Soul, Light, Dark, Judgement, Voice, Chaos, etc.
- They substitute any card to complete combos like Five of a Kind, Arcane Straight, or Double Joker Bomb.
- Multiple wilds enable special combos like Double Joker Bomb.
- Players must declare intended wild card use when played.

---

## Tiebreakers & Special Rules

- Higher values win ties (e.g., Angel beats Phoenix, which beats Raven).
- If values tie, suits from Court Sets break ties using a defined hierarchy  
  (e.g., Celestial > Umbral > Infernal > Verdant > Aetheric).
- Wild cards don’t break ties but complete winning combos.
- **Double Joker Bomb** beats any Full House or lower hands regardless of rank.

## Scoring System
